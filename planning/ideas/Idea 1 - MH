Dropped into the wilderness

You need to collect items like plants, mushrooms, bugs, ore, and creature parts. Some of thses have interesting effects, while others can be used to create useful items, weapons, and armor. 

Creatures get stronger and drop better loot, so does the environment.

What is the player's goal?  
Escape?  
Survive?  
Slay Something?  
Find treasure?  
Besides the main goal, should there be a quest board for additional rewards?  

Does the player have a town (or towns) to visit to buy or craft things?

Should the world be open, freely move between areas? (even if outclassed)  
Should it be fairly linear?  
Should it be linear with the ability to go back?  

Should creaturs respawn?  
Should the game promote farming creatures for loot?  
Or have mechanisms to restrict it?
